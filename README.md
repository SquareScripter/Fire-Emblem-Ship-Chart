# Fire-Emblem-Ship-Chart
This is a webpage to generate ship charts for Fire Emblem !

I made this as an exercise to learn HTML/CSS/JS.

To view the webpage, follow this link : https://squarescripter.github.io/Fire-Emblem-Ship-Chart/ (for now there are only Awakening and Birthright, but I will add Conquest and Revelations later on)

Thanks to [redtroubadour](http://redtroubadour.tumblr.com/) and [exaltedgrimleal](http://exaltedgrimleal.tumblr.com/) for providing the charts and tokens !

Please note that this is an unofficial site, and that the Fire Emblem series belongs to Nintendo.
