# Fire-Emblem-Ship-Chart
This is a webpage to generate ship charts for Fire Emblem !

I made this as an exercise to learn HTML/CSS/JS.

To view the webpage, follow this link : https://squarescripter.github.io/Fire-Emblem-Ship-Chart/

First, select your game and MY Unit gender, then select your ships !

To backup your changes, copy the save code somewhere safe. To restore your save, click *Load Save* and paste your code.

To get a higher-res image, click *Show Full Size*. You can then save it by *Roght Click > Save Image As...*

Thanks to [redtroubadour](http://redtroubadour.tumblr.com/) and [exaltedgrimleal](http://exaltedgrimleal.tumblr.com/) for providing the charts and tokens !

Please note that this is an unofficial site, and that the Fire Emblem series belongs to Nintendo.
